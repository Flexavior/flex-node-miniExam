  "Scenario": "Your organization is running a critical database application on Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployment. During an infrastructure failure, the primary database instance in one Availability Zone becomes unavailable.",
  "Question": "Which of the following best describes the failover process and its impact on application availability for a Multi-AZ RDS setup?",
  "Options": [
    "A. The primary instance automatically restarts in the same Availability Zone, and the DNS endpoint remains unchanged.",
    "B. The standby instance in the secondary Availability Zone automatically takes over as the new primary, and the DNS endpoint is updated to point to the new instance.",
    "C. The failover process requires manual intervention, and applications will experience prolonged downtime.",
    "D. During failover, data replication is paused, leading to potential data loss until the original primary is restored."
  ],
  "Answer": "B. The standby instance in the secondary Availability Zone automatically takes over as the new primary, and the DNS endpoint is updated to point to the new instance.",
  "Explanation": "In a Multi-AZ RDS setup, AWS automatically promotes the standby instance to the primary role during an infrastructure failure. The DNS endpoint for the database is updated to ensure minimal downtime. Option A is incorrect because the primary does not restart in the same AZ. Option C is incorrect because the failover process is automated and does not require manual intervention. Option D is incorrect because Multi-AZ deployments use synchronous replication to prevent data loss during failover."

  "Scenario": "You are tasked with building a real-time data pipeline to process millions of log events per second and generate analytics in real-time. Your solution must ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and seamless integration with downstream analytics tools.",
  "Question": "Which of the following AWS services and architecture would best meet the requirements for this real-time data pipeline?",
  "Options": [
    "A. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for ingesting log events, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time processing, and store the results in Amazon S3. Optionally, use AWS Lambda for custom event handling.",
    "B. Use Amazon SQS for log ingestion, Amazon CloudWatch for real-time analytics, and send data directly to Amazon RDS for storage.",
    "C. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to process log events in real time, Amazon Athena for querying, and enable shard auto-scaling for fault tolerance.",
    "D. Use Amazon Redshift for real-time log ingestion and analytics, integrated with Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for scalability."
  ],
  "Answer": "A. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for ingesting log events, Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics for real-time processing, and store the results in Amazon S3. Optionally, use AWS Lambda for custom event handling.",
  "Explanation": "Option A is correct as it provides a complete, scalable, and fault-tolerant architecture. Kinesis Data Streams handles high-throughput ingestion, Kinesis Data Analytics performs real-time SQL-like analysis, and S3 provides durable storage. Lambda enables custom event processing if needed. \n\nOption B is incorrect because SQS is not designed for real-time ingestion at scale, and CloudWatch is used for monitoring, not analytics. \n\nOption C incorrectly claims that Kinesis Data Firehose can perform real-time analytics; it is primarily for delivery, not computation, and does not support shard auto-scaling. \n\nOption D is incorrect because Amazon Redshift is not designed for real-time log ingestion and relies on batch processes, making it unsuitable for low-latency analytics pipelines."
